# COVID19_recognition
Creating a ML classification based model for dectecting COVID19 using CT scans of patients
The data set can be downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset](here).
This data needs to put as show in this tree directory => dataset
                                                           |->train->covid
                                                           |     |->non_covid
                                                           |->validation->covid
                                                                 |->non_covid
Then by classification algorithm, we can create a model which detects COVID19-infection status
