# COVID19_recognition
Creating a ML classification based model for dectecting COVID19 using CT scans of patients <br>
The data set can be downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset](here). <br>
This data needs to put as show in this tree directory => <br>
dataset <br>
&nbsp;|->train->covid <br>
 &nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|->non_covid <br>
 &nbsp;|->validation->covid <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|->non_covid <br>
Then by classification algorithm, we can create a model which detects COVID19-infection status <br>
